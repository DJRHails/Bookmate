# So

Seems impossible to successfully sync the bookmarks for any operation except "add", just by using the file system.

I think I will go the route of a bundled extension, and instrumenting a (22120 style) restarted Chrome, with a bridge extension bundled.

But this will take more work than I can pull off tonight...In reasonable time anyway. And I have done two nights of unreasonable time...so tonight I want to be far more reasonable.

So I think I will push something out that is an "append Only" filesystem for Chrome bookmarks.
